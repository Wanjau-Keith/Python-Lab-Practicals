# A module is a collection of functions that are grouped together in a single file e.g  math module
# math module has the following functions
# cos (cosine) and sqrt (square root).
# Importing Modules
# When you want to use a function from a module, you have to import it.
# To tell Python that you want to use functions in the math module, for example, you use this import statement:
# import math
import math
#print(help(math))
print(pow(4,3))
# pow(x)
# sqrt(x)
# tan(x)
# cos(x)
# Gross Income
print(math.sqrt(9))
print(pow(4,2))
print(help(math))

# the
# next
# floating - point
# value
# after
# x
# towards
# y.
#
# perm(n, k=None, /)
# Number
# of
# ways
# to
# choose
# k
# items
# from n items
#
# without
# repetition and
# with order.
#
# Evaluates
# to
# n! / (n - k)! when
# k <= n and evaluates
# to
# zero
# when
# k > n.
#
# If
# k is not specified or is None, then
# k
# defaults
# to
# n
# and the
# function
# returns
# n!.
#
# Raises
# TypeError if either
# of
# the
# arguments
# are
# not integers.
# Raises
# ValueError if either
# of
# the
# arguments
# are
# negative.
#
# pow(x, y, /)
# Return
# x ** y(x
# to
# the
# power
# of
# y).
#
# prod(iterable, /, *, start = 1)
# Calculate
# the
# product
# of
# all
# the
# elements in the
# input
# iterable.
#
# The
# default
# start
# value
# for the product is 1.
#
# When
# the
# iterable is empty,
# return the
# start
# value.This
# function is
# intended
# specifically
# for use with numeric values and may reject
# non - numeric
# types.
#
# radians(x, /)
# Convert
# angle
# x
# from degrees to
#
# radians.
#
# remainder(x, y, /)
# Difference
# between
# x and the
# closest
# integer
# multiple
# of
# y.
#
# Return
# x - n * y
# where
# n * y is the
# closest
# integer
# multiple
# of
# y.
# In
# the
# case
# where
# x is exactly
# halfway
# between
# two
# multiples
# of
# y, the
# nearest
# even
# value
# of
# n is used.The
# result is always
# exact.
#
# sin(x, /)
# Return
# the
# sine
# of
# x(measured in radians).
#
# sinh(x, /)
# Return
# the
# hyperbolic
# sine
# of
# x.
#
# sqrt(x, /)
# Return
# the
# square
# root
# of
# x.
#
# tan(x, /)
# Return
# the
# tangent
# of
# x(measured in radians).
#
# tanh(x, /)
# Return
# the
# hyperbolic
# tangent
# of
# x.
#
# trunc(x, /)
# Truncates
# the
# Real
# x
# to
# the
# nearest
# Integral
# toward
# 0.
#
# Uses
# the
# __trunc__
# magic
# method.
#
# ulp(x, /)
# Return
# the
# value
# of
# the
# least
# significant
# bit
# of
# the
# float
# x.
