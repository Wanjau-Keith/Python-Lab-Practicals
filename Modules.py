# A module is a collection of functions that are grouped together in a single file e.g  math module
# math module has the following functions
# cos (cosine) and sqrt (square root).
# Importing Modules
# When you want to use a function from a module, you have to import it.
# To tell Python that you want to use functions in the math module, for example, you use this import statement:
# import math
import math
print(help(math))
print(pow(4,3))
