# Variables are containers/location in memory for storing data values.
# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname,total_volume).
# Rules for Python variables:
# •	A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# •	A variable name cannot start with a number
# •	A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# •	Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

x=34

print(x)
