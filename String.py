# A program is a set of instructions
# String, is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols), str
# Example strings, Kelly, Fry20#$,
# Variable is a memory location.
# Variable name=M
# Assigning memeory location a value;
# str Name;
# Name=Nelly
# Data types
M='Kelly'
M='Kibet'
N=23
N=33
print(M)
print(N)
# + is a concatenation operator when used to join two strings e.g

print('Kel'+'ly')
print('Kelly'+" "+'is'+" "+"tall")

#rint 2 and 4 as 24

print('2'+'4')

# Output 123TR45 using concatenation operator where operands are 123 TR AND 45

print("123"+"TR"+'45')


# Escape Sequence Description
# \n End of line
# \\ Backslash
# \â€™ Single quote
# \" Double quote
# \t Tab

# Inserting quotations using escape sequence
# \' \"
# Wtite a code to output the following Prof. Kamau said, "I will be travelling on weekend".
print("Prof. Kamau said, \"I will be travelling on weekend\".")

print("She said,\'Im so weak\'")

# \n End of line
# This will output characters after the escape symbol on a new line.

print("My phone is Nokia\n model")
# \t Tab
# Introduce a tab bewtween characters or strings or sentences
print("The shop\tis not far from\tthis place\t and the place is\tcool")

#Write a program to output the following
# My new car  is MW "Model", she said   .
print("My new car\tis MW \"Model\",\t she said\t\t.")
print('My new car \tis MW \"Model\",\ she said\t.')

# Notes
# Python uses the string type str to represent text as sequences of characters.
# Strings are usually created by placing pairs of single or double quotes around the text. e.g "Kibet"
# Multiline strings can be created using matching pairs of triple quotes.
# Special characters like newline and tab are represented using escape sequences that begin with a backslash.
# Values can be displayed on the screen using a print statement and
# input can be provided by the user using input().
